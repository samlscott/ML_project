<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Introduction

The following paper is a comparison between two Machine Learning algorithms, namely Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, as prediction tools. Using a Linear Regression model as a baseline, the RMSE scores are compared.

# Research Question

Problem type: supervised binomial classification 

"Much like EDA, the ML process is very iterative and heurstic-based. With minimal knowledge of the problem or data at hand, it is difficult to know which ML method will perform best. This is known as the no free lunch theorem for ML (Wolpert 1996). Consequently, it is common for many ML approaches to be applied, evaluated, and modified before a final, optimal model can be determined. Performing this process correctly provides great confidence in our outcomes. If not, the results will be useless and, potentially, damaging.1"

"RMSE: Root mean squared error. This simply takes the square root of the MSE metric  so that your error is in the same units as your response variable. If your response variable units are dollars, the units of MSE are dollars-squared, but the RMSE will be in dollars. Objective: minimize"

# Data and Methodology 

The data used in this investigation is heart disease data from Kaggle. 

# Results and Discussion

## Linear Regression

```{r}
# Generating LRM 
LRM <- lm(heart_disease_present ~ ., data = heart_d)

summary(LRM)
sigma(LRM)
```

```{r}
ggscatter(heart_d, x = "age", y = "heart_disease_present", 
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson",
          xlab = "Age", ylab = "Heart Disease")
```
 
## Random Forests 

```{r}
# Generating model (textbook)
# number of features
n_features <- length(setdiff(names(heart_d), "heart_disease_present"))


# train a default random forest model
heart_d_rf1 <- ranger(
  heart_disease_present ~ ., 
  data = train_1,
  mtry = floor(n_features / 3),
  respect.unordered.factors = "order",
  seed = 123
)

# get OOB RMSE
(default_rmse <- sqrt(heart_d_rf1$prediction.error))
```
