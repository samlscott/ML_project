<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.

# Introduction

The following paper is a comparison between two Machine Learning algorithms, namely Random Forests and Support Vector Machines, as prediction tools. Using a Linear Regression model as a baseline, the RMSE scores are compared.

# Research Question

Problem type: supervised binomial classification 

"Much like EDA, the ML process is very iterative and heurstic-based. With minimal knowledge of the problem or data at hand, it is difficult to know which ML method will perform best. This is known as the no free lunch theorem for ML (Wolpert 1996). Consequently, it is common for many ML approaches to be applied, evaluated, and modified before a final, optimal model can be determined. Performing this process correctly provides great confidence in our outcomes. If not, the results will be useless and, potentially, damaging.1"

"RMSE: Root mean squared error. This simply takes the square root of the MSE metric  so that your error is in the same units as your response variable. If your response variable units are dollars, the units of MSE are dollars-squared, but the RMSE will be in dollars. Objective: minimize"

# Data and Methodology 

The data used in this investigation is heart disease data from Kaggle. 

"Support vector machines (SVMs) offer a direct approach to binary classification: try to find a hyperplane in some feature space that “best” separates the two classes. In practice, however, it is difficult (if not impossible) to find a hyperplane to perfectly separate the classes using just the original features. SVMs overcome this by extending the idea of finding a separating hyperplane in two ways: (1) loosen what we mean by “perfectly separates”, and (2) use the so-called kernel trick to enlarge the feature space to the point that perfect separation of classes is (more) likely."

# Results and Discussion

## Random Forests 

```{r}
# Generating RF Model (internet)

RFM = randomForest(heart_disease_present~., data = train_1, ntree=500)
print(RFM)
plot(RFM)
```


```{r}
floor(sqrt(ncol(train_1) - 1))
```

```{r}
mtry <- tuneRF(train_1[-1],train_1$heart_disease_present, ntreeTry=500,
               stepFactor=1.5,improve=0.01, trace=TRUE, plot=TRUE)
```

```{r}
best.m <- mtry[mtry[, 2] == min(mtry[, 2]), 1]
```

```{r}
print(mtry)
print(best.m)
```

```{r}
RFM1 = randomForest(heart_disease_present~., data = train_1, mtry=best.m, ntree=601, importance=TRUE)
print(RFM1)
plot(RFM1)
```


```{r}
# Evaluate model accuracy
Heart_pred = predict(RFM, test_1)
test_1$Heart_pred = Heart_pred
```

```{r}
# Build confusion matrix
CFM = table(test_1$heart_disease_present, test_1$Heart_pred)
plot(CFM)
```

```{r}
# Accuracy of the model
Classification_Accuracy = sum(diag(CFM)/sum(CFM))
Classification_Accuracy
```
 

```{r}
# Evaluate model accuracy
Heart_pred = predict(RFM1, test_1)
test_1$Heart_pred = Heart_pred
```

```{r}
# Build confusion matrix
CFM1 = table(test_1$heart_disease_present, test_1$Heart_pred)
plot(CFM1)
```

```{r}
# Accuracy of the model
Classification_Accuracy = sum(diag(CFM)/sum(CFM))
Classification_Accuracy
```

```{r}
pred1=predict(RFM,type = "prob")
library(ROCR)
perf = prediction(pred1[,2], train_1$heart_disease_present)
# 1. Area under curve
auc = performance(perf, "auc")
# 2. True Positive and Negative Rate
pred3 = performance(perf, "tpr","fpr")
# 3. Plot the ROC curve
plot(pred3,main="ROC Curve for Random Forest",col=2,lwd=2)
abline(a=0,b=1,lwd=2,lty=2,col="gray")
```

## Support Vector Machine

```{r}
# Tune an SVM with radial basis kernel
set.seed(1854)  # for reproducibility
churn_svm <- train(
    heart_disease_present ~ ., 
    data = train_1,
    method = "svmRadial",               
    preProcess = c("center", "scale"),  
    trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10),
    tuneLength = 10
)
```

```{r}
# Plot results
ggplot(churn_svm) + theme_light()
#churn_svm$results
```


```{r}
# Evaluate model accuracy
Heart_pred = predict(churn_svm, test_1)
test_1$Heart_pred = Heart_pred
```

```{r}
# Build confusion matrix
CFMsvm = table(test_1$heart_disease_present, test_1$Heart_pred)
plot(CFMsvm)
```

```{r}
# Accuracy of the model
Classification_Accuracy = sum(diag(CFMsvm)/sum(CFMsvm))
Classification_Accuracy
```
